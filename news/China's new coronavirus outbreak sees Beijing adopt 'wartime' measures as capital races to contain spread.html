在北京最大的食品批发市场出现了一系列新的新型冠状病毒病例之后，北京正重新采取严格的封锁措施，并展开大规模检测，引发了人们对致命爆发再次爆发的担忧。

 根据国家卫生委员会的数据，中国首都周一报告了36例新的Covid-19病例，自6月12日在两个月以来首次报告本地传播的感染以来，总数已达到79例。
 在北京市宣布近两个月没有新的本地感染病例之后，北京的食品批发市场出现了一批新的新型冠状病毒病例。
 在北京市宣布近两个月没有新的本地感染病例之后，北京的食品批发市场出现了一批新的新型冠状病毒病例。
 这些病例与该市西南部的新发地市场有关，该市场供应首都大部分的新鲜水果和蔬菜。 自周六以来，该市场也出售肉类和海鲜。
 疫情已经蔓延到辽宁省和河北省，在北京发现总共有五名新病例与患者密切接触。
 新的集群在全国各地引起了震动，北京市政府发言人徐鹤健在周日的新闻发布会上将其形容为“非同寻常的时期”。
 随着国外感染和死亡人数激增，中国官方媒体多次吹捧中国遏制该病毒的有效措施，将其成功与西方政府，尤其是美国的失败相提并论。

 北京以前突然被认为是该国最安全的城市之一，该病毒的突然复活增加了第二波感染的可能性，并且有可能重新引入以前导致该国大部分地区瘫痪和重击的全面封锁类型 经济。
 据国家新闻社新华社报道，在周日晚间的国务院会议上，国务院副总理孙春兰表示，最近一次疫情蔓延的风险“很高”，理由是市场人口众多且流动性很高。
 “战时”措施
 新发地市场所在地丰台区周六宣布启动“战时机制”，并建立指挥中心以遏制病毒的传播。
 在社交媒体上，中国政府经营的民族主义小报《环球时报》发布了一段录像，该录像显示准军事警察戴着口罩在市场周六关闭后巡逻。
 当局对市场附近的11个住宅区实施了封锁，严格禁止任何人进入或离开。 居民将每天进行体温检查和报告，并交付食物和日用品。
 北京还对冠状病毒进行了大规模核酸测试，在全市设立了193个采样站。 徐在周一的新闻发布会上说，周日有76,000多人接受测试，其中59人呈阳性。
 核酸检测通过检测病毒的遗传密码而起作用，并且比检测人体免疫应答的检测更有效地检测感染，尤其是在早期阶段，尽管后者更容易进行。
 丰台区已经收集了在新发地市场工作的8,950人的样本。 徐说，到目前为止，已经测试了6,000多个样品，结果均为阴性。
 当局还追踪并收集了在关闭市场前14天去过市场的将近30,000人的样本。 徐说，到目前为止进行的所有12,000次测试均显示阴性结果。

 北京市政府已下令任何拜访该市场及其亲密人士的人在家中待两周以进行医学观察。 这也推迟了原定于星期一开始的小学生复课的时间。
 疫情爆发后，包括丰台区副局长在内的几名地方官员已被解雇。
 病毒爆发不是病毒第一次感染。  5月，在进口病例引起当地社区暴发之后，该国东北部的几个地方被迅速封锁。
 然而，在新的疫情爆发之前，由于在大流行开始时施加了严格的旅行限制，北京仅记录了420例局部感染和9例死亡，而全国超过80,000例确诊病例和4,634例死亡。
 像全国其他大部分地区一样，随着商业和学校的重新开放，北京的生活开始恢复正常，人群又回到了购物中心，饭店和公园。
 为了表示对中国政府控制疫情的信心，该国议会在推迟了两个月之后，甚至于5月下旬举行了年度会议，使成千上万的代表从全国各地来到北京并肩坐下。 历时10天的会议。

 北京的爆发将是对中国冠状病毒遏制战略的最新检验。
 《环球时报》主编胡希金在推特上说，北京不会成为第二个武汉，武汉是去年12月首次发现冠状病毒的大流行的原始震中。
 “北京不可能成为武汉2.0。世界将看到中国在控制该流行病方面的强大能力，包括政府的强有力领导，对科学的尊重，公众的合作意愿以及在全国范围内协调控制措施。我们将再次获胜，  ”他周一在一篇文章中写道。
 然而，北京当局仍在努力寻找最新爆发的来源，并承诺进行“最严格的流行病学调查”。
 市场主席张玉玺周五告诉国营《新京报》，该病毒是在市场上进口鲑鱼的卖方使用的砧板上发现的，导致人们担心会受到更广泛的污染。 据《北京日报》报道，此后有几家连锁超市将鲑鱼从货架上移走。
 尽管调查仍在进行中，但北京疾病预防控制中心的一位研究人员说，基因组测序表明市场上发现的病毒与欧洲通常发现的病毒相似。
 研究人员杨鹏周日对中央电视台表示：“但仍不确定该病毒是如何起源的。它可能是由受污染的海鲜或肉类引起的，或是由通过分泌物进入市场的人传播的。”

Beijing is reintroducing strict lockdown measures and rolling out mass testing after a fresh cluster of novel coronavirus cases emerged from the city's largest wholesale food market, sparking fears of a resurgence of the deadly outbreak.

The Chinese capital reported 36 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, bringing the total number to 79 since a locally transmitted infection was reported on June 12 for the first time in nearly two months, according to the National Health Commission.
A fresh cluster of novel coronavirus cases have emerged from a wholesale food market in Beijing, after the city reported no new local infections for nearly two months.
A fresh cluster of novel coronavirus cases have emerged from a wholesale food market in Beijing, after the city reported no new local infections for nearly two months.
The cases are linked to Xinfadi market in the southwest of the city, which supplies most of the capital's fresh fruit and vegetables. The market, which also sells meat and seafood, has been shut down since Saturday.
The outbreak has already spread to the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, where a total of five new cases were found to be close contacts of patients in Beijing.
The new cluster has sent shock waves throughout China, with Beijing's municipal government spokesman Xu Hejian describing it as "an extraordinary period" during a press conference Sunday.
Chinese state media has repeatedly touted China's effective measures in containing the virus as the number of infections and deaths surged abroad, contrasting its success with the failures of Western governments, especially the United States.

The sudden reemergence of the virus in Beijing, previously considered among the country's safest cities, has raised the prospect of a second wave of infections and the possible reintroduction of the types of sweeping lockdowns that had previously brought much of the country to a halt and hammered the economy.
At a meeting of the State Council, China's cabinet, late on Sunday, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said the risk of the latest outbreak spreading was "very high," citing the market's dense and highly mobile population, according to state news agency Xinhua.
"Wartime" measures
Fengtai district, where the Xinfadi market is located, announced Saturday the launch of a "wartime mechanism" and the establishment of a command center to curb the spread of the virus.
On social media, the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid run by the Chinese government, posted a video of paramilitary police officers donning face masks patrolling the market after it was closed down on Saturday.
Authorities imposed a lockdown on 11 residential compounds in the vicinity of the market, strictly prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. Residents will have their temperatures checked and reported on a daily basis, and their food and daily necessities delivered.
Beijing also rolled out mass nucleic acid testing for the coronavirus, setting up 193 sampling booths across the city. More than 76,000 people were tested on Sunday, with 59 people testing positive, Xu said at a news conference on Monday.
Nucleic acid tests work by detecting the virus' genetic code, and can be more effective at detecting an infection, particularly in the early stages, than tests which examine a body's immune response, though the latter are easier to conduct.
Fengtai district has collected samples from 8,950 people who worked in the Xinfadi market. So far, more than 6,000 samples have been tested and the results are all negative, according to Xu.
Authorities also tracked down and collected samples from nearly 30,000 people who had been to the market in the 14 days prior to its closure. All of the 12,000 tests conducted so far showed negative results, Xu said.

The Beijing government has ordered anyone who visited the market and their close contacts to stay home for two weeks for medical observation. It also delayed the resumption of classes for elementary school students, which was originally scheduled for Monday.
Several local officials, including the deputy head of Fengtai district, have been dismissed following the outbreak.
The outbreak is not the first time the virus has returned. In May, several places in the country's northeast were swiftly placed under stringent lockdown after imported cases caused outbreaks among local communities.
Before the new cluster, however, Beijing had only recorded 420 local infections and 9 deaths compared to over 80,000 confirmed cases and 4,634 deaths nationwide, thanks to its strict travel restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic.
Like much of the rest of the country, life in Beijing had started to return to normal, with businesses and schools reopening, and crowds returning to shopping malls, restaurants and parks.
In a sign of the Chinese government's confidence in its control of the outbreak, the country's parliament even held its annual gathering in late May after a two-month delay, allowing thousands of delegates to traveled to Beijing from across the country and sit side by side for meetings that lasted 10 days.

Tracing the source
The outbreak in Beijing will be the latest test of China's coronavirus containment strategy.
Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of Global Times, said on Twitter that Beijing will not become the second Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic where the coronavirus was first detected in December last year.
"There is no way Beijing becomes Wuhan 2.0. The world will see China's powerful capacity in controlling the epidemic, including (the) government's strong leadership, respect to science, public's willingness to cooperate and nationwide coordination of control measures. We will win again," he wrote in a post Monday.
Beijing authorities are still trying to trace the source of the latest outbreak, however, pledging to conduct "the strictest epidemiological investigations."
Zhang Yuxi, the market's chairman, told the state-run Beijing News on Friday that the virus had been detected on a chopping board used by a seller of imported salmon at the market, leading to fears of wider contamination. Several supermarket chains have since removed salmon from their shelves, according to Beijing Daily.
While investigations are still underway, a researcher with the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control said genome sequencing indicated the virus found in the market is similar to strains normally found in Europe.
"But it is still uncertain how the virus originated. It could have come from contaminated seafood or meat, or been transmitted by people who have come into the market via their secretions," Yang Peng, the researcher, told state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday.
